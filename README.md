# Data Analysis Projects

## Overview

This repository contains two data analysis projects: **PyBank** and **PyPoll**. These projects use Python and Pandas to analyze financial and election data, respectively. The PyBank project focuses on financial performance metrics, while the PyPoll project analyzes election results to determine vote distribution and winners.

## Project Description

This repository contains two separate analysis scripts:

- **PyBank Analysis**: Analyzes financial data to compute total months, net profit/losses, average changes, and the greatest increase/decrease in profits.
- **PyPoll Analysis**: Analyzes election data to compute the total number of votes, the percentage and total votes for each candidate, and identifies the election winner.

## Installation

To run these projects locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-analysis-projects.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd data-analysis-projects
   ```
3. **Install Required Libraries:**
   Ensure you have Pandas installed. If not, you can install it using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

## Usage

### PyBank Analysis

1. **Load the Data:**
   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   csv_path = '/path/to/budget_data.csv'
   budget_data = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
   ```
2. **Perform Analysis:**
   ```python
   def calculate_total_months(df):
       total_months = df["Date"].nunique()
       return total_months

   def calculate_total_profit(df):
       profit = df["Profit/Losses"].sum()
       return profit

   def calculate_average_change(df):
       df['Monthly Change'] = df["Profit/Losses"].diff()
       average_change = df['Monthly Change'][1:].mean()
       return average_change

   def calculate_greatest_increase(df):
       max_increase = df['Monthly Change'].max()
       max_increase_date = df.loc[df['Monthly Change'] == max_increase, 'Date'].iloc[0]
       return max_increase_date, max_increase

   def calculate_greatest_decrease(df):
       max_decrease = df['Monthly Change'].min()
       max_decrease_date = df.loc[df['Monthly Change'] == max_decrease, 'Date'].iloc[0]
       return max_decrease_date, max_decrease
   ```

### PyPoll Analysis

1. **Load the Data:**
   ```python
   from collections import Counter
   csv_path = '/path/to/election_data.csv'
   voting_data = pd.read_csv(csv_path)
   ```
2. **Perform Analysis:**
   ```python
   def calculate_total_votes(df):
       total_votes = df["Ballot ID"].nunique()
       return total_votes

   def calculate_candidate_list(df):
       names = df["Candidate"]
       name_counts = Counter(names)
       return name_counts

   def calculate_winner(df):
       names = df["Candidate"]
       name_counts = Counter(names)
       most_votes = name_counts.most_common(1)[0]
       return most_votes
   ```

## Results
